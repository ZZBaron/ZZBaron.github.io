# About this Website
This website was generated using [Franklin.jl](https://franklinjl.org/) — a simple, flexible static-site generator written in Julia that’s ideal for technical portfolios, project showcases, and blogs.

Why Franklin.jl?  
- It converts Markdown and LaTeX into static HTML, letting me write content quickly while still supporting rich formatting like math, code blocks, or custom HTML components.
- It lets me embed and even live-evaluate Julia code snippets.
- Integration with GitHub pages.

I use custom HTML and CSS for custom styles/layouts, and JavaScript for interactive elements, such as this [stock simulation](../stock_sim).

**Skills**  
- Web & front-end: HTML, CSS, JS
- Julia: data analysis, scientific computing, visualization
- Technical writing: LaTeX
