            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project models and visualizes the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system and its enhanced variants, highlighting predator-prey population cycles over time. The foundational mathematical model was independently developed by Lotka (1920) and Volterra (1926).</p>

            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic Lotka-Volterra model with predator-prey interactions</li>
                <li>Enhanced model with additional ecological factors for realism</li>
                <li>Visualizations of population dynamics and functional responses</li>
                <li>Animated phase space visualization</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Lotka-Volterra Model</h2>
            <p>The Lotka-Volterra model describes predator-prey interactions through a system of non-linear differential equations (Lotka, 1920; Volterra, 1926):</p>
            <p>\[ \frac{dx}{dt} = \alpha x - \beta xy  \; \; \text{[Prey dynamics]} \]</p>
            <p>\[ \frac{dy}{dt} = \delta xy - \gamma y  \; \; \text{[Predator dynamics]} \]</p>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>\(x\) = Prey population</li>
                <li>\(y\) = Predator population</li>
                <li>\(\alpha\) = Prey growth rate</li>
                <li>\(\beta\) = Predation rate</li>
                <li>\(\gamma\) = Predator death rate</li>
                <li>\(\delta\) = Predator growth rate due to consuming prey</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Model Limitations</h3>
            <p>The basic model has several limitations as discussed by Gurney and Nisbet (1998):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unlimited Prey Growth:</strong> Assumes exponential prey growth without resource limits.</li>
                <li><strong>Linear Predation Response:</strong> Ignores predator satiation and handling time.</li>
                <li><strong>No Time Delays:</strong> Immediate population responses, though natural systems show delays.</li>
                <li><strong>Constant Parameters:</strong> Ignores seasonal/environmental changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Perfect Cycles:</strong> The model predicts ideal cycles, which rarely occur in nature.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>A Modified Lotka-Volterra Model</h2>
            <p>To address the limitations of the basic model, I introduce an enhanced version that incorporates logistic growth for prey, seasonal variations, and a Holling Type II functional response with predator interference (Holling, 1959). The modified equations are as follows:</p>

            <p>\[ \frac{dx}{dt} = r x \left( 1 - \frac{x}{K} \right) - y S f(x,y) \; \; \text{[Prey dynamics]} \]</p>
            <p>\[ \frac{dy}{dt}(t) = c y(t) S(t) f\left(x(t-\tau),y(t) \right) - m y(t) \; \; \text{[Predator dynamics]} \]</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prey Growth Rate (\(r\)):</strong> This is the maximum growth rate of the prey population in the absence of predators. It reflects the reproductive potential of the prey species.</li>
                <li><strong>Carrying Capacity (\(K\)):</strong> This is the maximum sustainable population size that the environment can support, taking resource limitations into account. It prevents the prey population from growing indefinitely.</li>
                <li><strong>Seasonal Factor (\(S (t)\)):</strong> This term introduces seasonal variations in the model, affecting both predation and predator growth rates. It is modeled as a sinusoidal function that varies over time, reflecting how environmental conditions (such as temperature and resource availability) change throughout the year.</li>
                <li><strong>Functional Response (\(f(x,y)\)):</strong> This term describes the relationship between prey density and the rate at which predators consume prey. It captures the non-linear dynamics of predator-prey interactions, accounting for factors like prey availability and predator efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Time Lag (\(\tau\)):</strong> This term accounts for the delayed response of the predator population to changes in prey abundance. It reflects the fact that reproduction in predators lags behind changes in prey availability.</li>
                <li><strong>Predator Mortality (\(m\)):</strong> This term represents the natural death rate of the predator population, where \(m\) is the mortality rate of predators. It decreases the predator population over time, regardless of prey availability.</li>
                <li><strong>Conversion Efficiency (\(c\)):</strong> This term represents how efficiently predators convert consumed prey into their own biomass. It reflects the energy transfer from prey to predator in the food web.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Model Justifications</h2>
            <h3>Prey Logistic Growth</h3>
            <p>Incorporating logistic growth for the prey population ensures that growth is self-limiting, preventing unrealistic exponential growth. This reflects ecological principles where natural populations are constrained by available resources (Gurney & Nisbet, 1998). The carrying capacity \(K\) sets an upper limit for the prey population in the absence of predators.</p>

            <h3>Holling Type II Functional Response with Predator Interference</h3>
            <p>The functional response \(f(x,y)\) is modeled using a Holling Type II function with predator interference (Holling, 1959):</p>
            <p>\[ f(x,y) = \frac{ax}{1 + ahx + qy} \]</p>
            <p>This accounts for the fact that as prey density increases, the rate at which predators can consume prey starts to saturate due to handling time and predator interference. \(a\) is the attack rate, \(h\) is the handling time, and \(q\) is the predator interference coefficient, which accounts for the reduction in hunting efficiency as predator density increases.</p>

            <h3>Seasonal Variations</h3>
            <p>Seasonal fluctuations are modeled with a sinusoidal function for the seasonal factor \(S\), which affects both predation and predator growth rates as suggested by ecological dynamics research (Gurney & Nisbet, 1998):</p>
            <p>\[ S = 1 + A \cdot \sin(2\pi t/12) \]</p>
            <p>This introduces periodic variations in the model, reflecting how environmental conditions (such as temperature and resource availability) change throughout the year, impacting predator and prey populations.</p>

            <h3>Time Lag in Predator Response</h3>
            <p>A time lag \(\tau\) is introduced to account for the delayed response of the predator population to changes in prey abundance. This reflects the fact that reproduction in predators lags behind changes in prey availability. The time lag is incorporated in the equation for predator growth, where the prey density at a previous time \(x(t-\tau)\) is used to determine predator growth.</p>

            <h2>Remaining Limitations</h2>
            <p>Despite improvements, the enhanced model still faces limitations as identified in ecological modeling literature (Gurney & Nisbet, 1998):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spatial Homogeneity:</strong> Assumes well-mixed populations without spatial structures.</li>
                <li><strong>Age/Size Structure:</strong> Ignores differences in age/size within species.</li>
                <li><strong>Species Interactions:</strong> Only two species are modeled, while real ecosystems involve more interactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Evolutionary Dynamics:</strong> Doesn't account for evolutionary changes over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Stochasticity:</strong> Random environmental factors are excluded.</li>
                <li><strong>Demographic Stochasticity:</strong> Birth and death rates are treated deterministically.</li>
                <li><strong>Parameter Sensitivity:</strong> The model is sensitive to parameter values that are difficult to measure.</li>
            </ul>
